Discussed the problem I hit when creating certificate from file and that there was no encrypt by master when doing so. Need to detail that.

Question about MSAs and GMSAs that might be able to overcome the security issues and avoid using certificates?
- I said that if it was possible to create a login from the MSA or GMSA (so that you could grant connect) then yes that should be great -so you are not messing about with certificates. However I don't think that is possible. Must look this up.
- Note that you GMSAs are mentioned in the feature versions slide - so need to validated that is correct for AGs and not just SQL Server/ Windows.

Erland mentioned direct seeding which we try during the teardown and GUI deploy. This should really be part of the demo for the GUI deploy.

I did my readonly routing demo after the backups on secondary demo -and for both did not do the slides
